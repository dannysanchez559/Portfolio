            I didn't always have the best credit. At age 21 I applied for my first credit card from Capital One. I heard
            it was a really easy 1st credit card to apply and get approved on, for those starting with their credit. Holding
            onto that credit card as the years went by, helped out my score. Also not owning a lot of debt, and making payments on time too.
            I recently had a personal loan from a bank, that I paid off after about a year and a half. That significantly boosted up my credit score.

            Now I get recommended new credit cards all the time. Mostly also because I have a friend that loves to take advantage of bonus offers from opening up
            new credit lines. I took advantage of that, and save up the bonus money to buy things I will eventually need (such as paying off my new iPhone).

          <p class="indent">
            A lot of the newest credit cards I have also have cashback options that pay me a percentage based on what category I use the credit card on. For example,
            for one quarter, one of my credit cards may have a 5% cash back category for gas, or groceries. Which is good because those are things I need regardless.
            Why not make money back on things I buy anyway? Last year I made at least $800 in credit card cashback with a combined sign-on bonus!
          </p>

          <p class="indent">
            I just make sure I don't overspend and pay off my credit cards at least once or twice a month, that way I don't accrue any interest.
            Here are some links to my current favorite credit cards, some may promotions, so take advantage!
